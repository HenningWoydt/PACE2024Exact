# Crossing-Guard: Keeping Edges in Line

## Install
use `./build.sh` to build `crossingguard` in `build`. No additional libraries are required.

## Usage
Use `crossingguard file-in file-out` to solve one problem. The `file-in` should be in the `.gr` format.
Alternatively you can also call `crossingguard` and print the contents of the file via `cin` and the output will be printed via `cout`.
